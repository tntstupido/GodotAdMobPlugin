# libs/

Place the Godot engine AAR here before building.

Download from the official Godot release matching your project version:
https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases

Filename example (Godot 4.3 stable):
  godot-lib.4.3.stable.release.aar

Rename it or keep the original name — build.gradle.kts picks up all *.aar files in this directory.
